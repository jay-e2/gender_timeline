Early life forms reproduced asexually, similar to binary fission, which posed an evolutionary bottleneck due to the lack of genetic diversity."

Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two gametes, each carrying half of the parent's genetic material, combining different genetic backgrounds and producing offspring with novel genetic combinations."

This divergence laid the foundation for the evolution of sexual dimorphism and gender-specific reproductive strategies."
