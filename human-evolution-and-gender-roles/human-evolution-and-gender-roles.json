        "text": "Parental investment theory explains differences in male and female reproductive strategies based on the relative investment each sex makes in offspring. Typically, females invest more heavily in offspring due to gestation and lactation, leading to choosiness in mate selection and a focus on securing resources for offspring. Males, on the other hand, may compete for access to females and exhibit behaviours that maximize their reproductive output. Del Giudice (2009) suggests that early psychosocial stress and insecure attachment lead to different reproductive strategies in males and females, indicating that environmental cues shape sex-specific reproductive behaviours. In contemporary society, these evolutionary pressures manifest in gender roles where women are often seen as primary caregivers and men as providers or protectors."

        "text": "The development and use of tools have been crucial in shaping human evolution and gender-specific tasks. In early human communities, tool use likely influenced the division of labour, with different tasks being assigned based on gender. Evidence suggests that men were more involved in hunting and tool-making activities that required strength and precision, while women focused on gathering and processing plant materials, reflecting a division of labour that maximized the efficiency of early human groups (Lombard & Haidle 2012). The evolution of bipedalism had significant implications for the division of labour between genders in early human societies. Bipedalism freed the hands for carrying tools and food, enabling more complex social structures and task specialization. It is hypothesized that bipedalism facilitated the development of gender-specific roles by allowing men to engage in long-distance hunting and women to carry infants and gather resources. Studies suggest that the physical adaptations associated with bipedalism, such as changes in pelvis structure and lower limb mechanics, influenced the types of activities that men and women could efficiently perform, leading to a more pronounced division of labour  (Lovejoy 1981)."

        "text": "Archaeological evidence from Neanderthal sites provides insights into the gendered division of labour in these early human relatives. Analysis of skeletal remains and tool use patterns suggests that Neanderthals had specialized roles based on gender, with men primarily responsible for hunting and women for gathering and processing food. A study by Kuhn and Stiner (2006) indicates that Neanderthal gender roles were influenced by ecological conditions and subsistence strategies, with gender-specific tasks enhancing group survival. These findings highlight the adaptability and complexity of Neanderthal social structures. The evolution of Homo sapiens brought about significant changes in social organization, culture, and technology, all of which impacted gender roles. Advances in social organization, such as the development of agriculture and urbanization, led to more complex gender roles and social hierarchies. Genetic and hormonal differences have played a crucial role in shaping contemporary gender roles, influencing behaviours, physical characteristics, and social dynamics (Archer 2019). Research on modern human evolution shows that differences in gene expression and hormonal influences have contributed to gender-specific traits and behaviours, affecting everything from risk-taking to parental care."
