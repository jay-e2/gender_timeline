        "text": "The emergence of primates approximately 55 million years ago marked a significant evolutionary event characterized by the development of distinctive morphological traits and social behaviours. Fossil evidence, such as the nearly complete skeleton of Archicebus achilles from the early Eocene, reveals that early primates were small, arboreal, and likely diurnal insectivores. This period established the foundational traits of the primate lineage, including enhanced visual acuity and grasping hands, which set the stage for more complex social interactions and gender-specific roles (Ni et al., 2013)."

        "text": "In the period following the emergence of primates, roughly 55 to 50 million years ago, early primates developed rudimentary social structures that were crucial for survival in their arboreal habitats. These social structures likely involved basic hierarchies and gender-specific roles centred around reproduction and resource acquisition. The development of such structures can be inferred from the social behaviours observed in modern primates, which often involve complex group dynamics and cooperative behaviours that enhance survival and reproductive success (Gingerich, 2006)."

        "headline": "Gender Segregation in Early Primates",
        "text": "Around 45 million years ago, gender segregation began to emerge more distinctly in primate social structures. This segregation was likely driven by differing roles in foraging and child-rearing, with females typically assuming primary responsibility for offspring care and males focusing on territory defence and resource gathering. These early forms of gender segregation helped optimize the survival and reproductive success of primate groups by allowing for specialization and division of labour within the species (Lovejoy, 1981)."

        "headline": "Sexual Selection Shaping Traits",
        "text": "Approximately 40 million years ago, sexual selection started to play a pivotal role in shaping physical and behavioural traits in primates. Traits such as body size and mating behaviours began to diverge significantly between genders, driven by the pressures of mate competition and selection. Males often developed larger body sizes and more pronounced physical displays to attract females, while females evolved traits that enhanced their reproductive success and offspring survival. These sexually selected traits have continued to evolve, contributing to the diversity observed in modern primates (Plavcan, 2002)."

        "text": "By around 20 million years ago, the genetic basis of gender-specific traits had become more pronounced in primates. Advances in genetic and genomic research indicate that certain genes are responsible for the development of traits that differentiate males and females, such as those involved in hormone regulation and reproductive anatomy. These genetic differences underpin the physical and behavioural distinctions between genders, influencing social behaviours, reproductive strategies, and even brain structure and function (Del Giudice, 2009)."

        "text": "Environmental changes around 10 million years ago had a profound impact on the evolution of gender-specific behaviours in primates. As climates fluctuated and habitats transformed, primate species adapted by altering their social structures and reproductive strategies. These adaptations included changes in mating systems, such as the shift from solitary living to more complex social groups, and the development of behaviours that enhanced survival in changing environments. These evolutionary pressures reinforced gender-specific roles and contributed to the diversification of primate species (Janzen & Phillips, 2006)."

        "text": "The development of tool use and bipedalism in early hominins introduced new dimensions to gender-specific tasks. Tool use allowed for more efficient food acquisition and processing, while bipedalism freed the hands for carrying objects and infants. These advancements likely led to a division of labour based on gender, with males typically engaging in hunting and tool-making and females focusing on gathering and child care. This division of labour would have reinforced social bonds and cooperative behaviours within early human groups (Lovejoy, 1981)."
