        "text": "In ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, gender roles were rigidly defined and deeply rooted in societal structures. Men typically engaged in public life, politics, and warfare, while women were confined to domestic roles. These early civilizations laid the groundwork for contemporary gender norms through their legal systems and cultural practices, and ensured that women remained subordinate, impacting their social and economic status. While these historical analyses provide a foundation, it is crucial to question the extent to which these rigid structures were universally enforced. Evidence suggests that in less documented areas and among lower classes, women might have had more varied roles, often participating in local trade and agricultural activities which were less controlled by formal legal codes. For example, in ancient Egypt, women of lower classes often worked alongside men in the fields and engaged in trade (Lesko, 1991). This indicates that economic necessity could override formal gender norms, leading to more fluid gender roles in practice."
