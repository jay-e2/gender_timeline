Men typically engaged in public life, politics, and warfare, while women were confined to domestic roles. These early civilizations laid the groundwork for contemporary gender norms through their legal systems and cultural practices, and ensured that women remained subordinate, impacting their social and economic status. While these historical analyses provide a foundation, it is crucial to question the extent to which these rigid structures were universally enforced. Evidence suggests that in less documented areas and among lower classes, women might have had more varied roles, often participating in local trade and agricultural activities which were less controlled by formal legal codes. For example, in ancient Egypt, women of lower classes often worked alongside men in the fields and engaged in trade (Lesko, 1991). This indicates that economic necessity could override formal gender norms, leading to more fluid gender roles in practice."

The intellectual discourse of the Enlightenment opened up discussions about women's rights and their roles in society. Influential thinkers like Mary Wollstonecraft argued for women's education and participation in public life, advocating for gender equality in a more systematic manner (De Lemus et al., 2018). Nevertheless, societal changes were slow, and while the Enlightenment sowed seeds for future gender equality movements, practical changes in women's daily lives were limited and often met with significant societal resistance (Aidala, 1985; De Lemus et al., 2018)."

Despite these gains, the 1980s also revealed underlying resistance to gender equality. Occupational segregation, while decreasing, persisted, particularly in fields traditionally dominated by men. Women entering male-dominated fields often faced subtle forms of discrimination, including biases in hiring and pay (England et al., 2020).

Cultural attitudes towards gender roles also began to shift more noticeably in the 1990s. The norm of full-time work for men persisted, placing additional pressures on women to balance family responsibilities with their careers.
