        "text": "While the distinct and well-documented gendered division of labour is more evident in the Upper Palaeolithic around 45,000 years ago, there are indications that some form of gender-specific roles may have existed earlier. Archaeological evidence from the Late Pleistocene (approximately 100,000-50,000 years ago) suggests that early human societies were beginning to develop more specialized roles based on gender. This period marks the initial stages of differentiated economic roles that laid the foundation for more complex social structures observed later (Kuhn & Stiner, 2006)."

        "text": "Approximately 45,000 years ago, during the early Upper Palaeolithic, human societies exhibited a more defined and pronounced gendered division of labour. This period saw the inclusion of a wider variety of small-animal resources in human diets, indicating specialized roles for males and females in subsistence activities. These changes likely provided demographic advantages by ensuring more stable food supplies and fostering cooperative economies (Kuhn & Stiner, 2006)."

        "text": "Between 45,000 and 30,000 years ago, anatomically modern humans in Eurasia developed cooperative economies characterized by complementary subsistence roles for men and women. These diversified and cooperative roles enhanced the adaptive capabilities of modern humans, contributing to their evolutionary success over Neandertals. The emergence of these economies facilitated efficient resource use and population expansion (Kuhn & Stiner, 2006)."
