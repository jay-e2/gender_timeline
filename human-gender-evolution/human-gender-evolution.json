        "text": "Parental investment theory explains differences in male and female reproductive strategies based on relative investment in offspring. Typically, females invest more heavily in offspring due to gestation and lactation, leading to choosiness in mate selection and a focus on securing resources for offspring. Males, on the other hand, may compete for access to females and exhibit behaviours that maximize their reproductive output. Del Giudice (2009) suggests that early psychosocial stress and insecure attachment lead to different reproductive strategies in males and females, indicating that environmental cues shape sex-specific reproductive behaviours and furthering the evolution of gender roles."
